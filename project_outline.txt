STEP 1: Parse the PDF 

Detailed Directions & Parsing Logic (Provided by Client):
These rules are not suggestions — they are your parsing requirements:

Program Number
    - Always starts each record in the PDF.
    - Remove the brackets.
    - Must be a clean 10-digit value.

Program Name
    - Appears immediately after the Program Number.
    - Often split across 1–3 lines.
    - Must stop before the address or “Ph:” line.
    - Do not include address lines.

Program Director Name
    - Appears below the email address and before the “Accreditation Status.”
    - Must include first and last name and the degree(s) (e.g., MD, DO, MBBS, etc.).
    - Prior attempts using AI tools only returned "MD" or "DO" — this is not acceptable.
    - The full name does exist and must be extracted.

Email Address
    - There is one email per record.
    - Some may be missing — if so, mark as blank.
    - Email must be clean and valid.

Preliminary Position
    - Appears at the end of each program block.
    - Must be extracted and standardized as “Yes” or “No”.
    -Spacing & Layout
    -There is no table structure.
    -Records are inconsistently spaced and wrapped.
    -Only the 10-digit program number can reliably separate records.
